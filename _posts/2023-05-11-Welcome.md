# Welcome to My Blog!
Hi! I'm Jack. I'm not exactly sure what I want to do for a living yet, but here are my 3 main interests:
 - Cybersecurity
 - User Experience (UX)
 - Data Science

Of the three, I think I'm most interested in data science at the moment.

In this blog, you'll most likely see me writing about one of those 3 subjects. Every so often, though, you'll find me documenting random stuff about my daily life, cuz all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.

To view my CV, see [my about page](https://jaclenga.github.io/about/).
