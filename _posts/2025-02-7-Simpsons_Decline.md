Another entry for [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/main). I'm a little late to the party this time. School has been rough.

As you can see, as time passed by, *The Simpsons* got worse and worse throughout the 2010s (according to IMDB data). 

This is absolutely not my best work. I do, however, plan to explore this dataset a lot more. You'll see a lot more Simpsons content from this point forward.
